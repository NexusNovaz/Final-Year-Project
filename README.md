# Final-Year-Project
This was my submission for my final year project. This achieved helped me to achieve 66% overrall. There was a report that contributed to that, however, that will not be uploaded due to possible plagarism.

# The idea
The idea of this project was to help users of discord to revise using a flashcard/quiz.

* It uses the googleapi to interact with google sheets, where users can create their own quizzes
* [Discord.js](https://discord.js.org/) to interact with the Discord API
* A [MongoDB](https://mongodb.com) database to store information as well as [mongoose](https://www.mongodb.com/developer/languages/javascript/getting-started-with-mongodb-and-mongoose/) to interract with the database
Specific versions of the packages used can be found [here](package.json)


# Running
To run the bot, just copy the repository and make sure to `npm i` and edit the `config.json.example` file to fit your needs. Rename said file to `config.json` and finally run `npm start`.
